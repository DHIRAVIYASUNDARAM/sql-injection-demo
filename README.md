## üöÄ Getting Started

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- PHP and MySQL (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP)
- Web browser

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DHIRAVIYASUNDARAM/sql-injection-demo.git
   ```

2. **Import the Database**

   - Open **phpMyAdmin** (or MySQL command line).
   - Create a new database named, for example: `sqldemo`.
   - Click **Import** and upload the `db.sql` file from this repository.

3. **Deploy the App Locally**

   - Move the `sql-injection-demo` folder into your web server‚Äôs root directory:
     - For XAMPP: `C:/xampp/htdocs/`
     - For WAMP: `C:/wamp64/www/`
   - Launch **XAMPP** or your preferred stack.
   - Start both **Apache** and **MySQL** services.

4. **Open the application in your browser**

   ```
   http://localhost/sql-injection-demo/
   ```

## üß™ Demonstrating the SQL Injection

To demonstrate the vulnerability, try entering this input in the login form:

```sql
' OR '1'='1
```

This will bypass authentication and log you in without valid credentials, showcasing how SQL injection works.

## üß† Learning Outcomes

- Understand how SQL Injection compromises web apps.
- Learn the dangers of using unsanitized user input in SQL queries.
- Recognize the importance of secure coding practices like input validation and prepared statements.
